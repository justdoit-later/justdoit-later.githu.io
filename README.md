# Just Do It Later 

A philosophy, a mindset to live happly ever after. 

Let the flow, go. 

Omnipresence = Absence.

The good things in life does not necessarily requires hard work to get.
We don't have to search for it. 

Rest.

Sleep on it.


Just do it later,

[Homer Simson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Simpson)
